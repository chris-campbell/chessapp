# ChessMate

Chessmate is a collaborative capstone application for The Firehose Project. Our team developed this application from the ground up; from discussing wireframing to conceptualizing the scheme, to turning ideas into code. Chessmate is designed to be a chess application that players can play against each other anywhere in the world. Most of the application has been fleshed out but like all applications, its a work in progress.
